      "### Evaluation of Responses\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Original Query Response\n",
      "**Score: 2/10**\n",
      "- **Strengths:** None; it does not provide any relevant information.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** The response indicates a lack of information, which is unhelpful for the user seeking food resources. It fails to address the query about emergency food in ZIP code 17104.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Rewrite Query Response\n",
      "**Score: 3/10**\n",
      "- **Strengths:** Slightly more specific than the original, as it acknowledges the ZIP code.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** Still does not provide any actionable information or resources. It merely states a lack of information without offering any guidance or suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Step_back Query Response\n",
      "**Score: 8/10**\n",
      "- **Strengths:** Provides specific resources, including names, locations, and contact information for food assistance in the area. It also mentions the SNAP Outreach Program and the requirement for self-declaration, which adds valuable context.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** While it includes multiple resources, it could have been more concise and focused on the most relevant options for the ZIP code in question. The mention of the Lancaster County Food Hub, while helpful, may not be as relevant since it is not in the immediate area.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Decompose Query Response\n",
      "**Score: 7/10**\n",
      "- **Strengths:** Similar to the step_back response, it provides specific resources and contact information. It correctly identifies the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank and mentions the SNAP Outreach Program.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** The inclusion of the Midwest Food Bank of Pennsylvania is less relevant since it is not located in the 17104 ZIP code. The response could have been more concise and focused on the most pertinent information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ranking of Techniques\n",
      "1. **Step_back Query Response (8/10)**\n",
      "2. **Decompose Query Response (7/10)**\n",
      "3. **Rewrite Query Response (3/10)**\n",
      "4. **Original Query Response (2/10)**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Best Technique\n",
      "The **Step_back Query Response** performed the best overall because it provided the most comprehensive and relevant information regarding food resources in the specified ZIP code. It included multiple options, contact details, and additional context about eligibility for assistance, making it the most useful for the user. The **Decompose Query Response** was also strong but slightly less effective due to the inclusion of less relevant information. The original and rewrite responses failed to provide any actionable information, making them the least effective.\n",
