    "## Context-Enriched Retrieval in RAG\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant knowledge from external sources. Traditional retrieval methods return isolated text chunks, which can lead to incomplete answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we introduce Context-Enriched Retrieval, which ensures that retrieved information includes neighboring chunks for better coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps in This Notebook:\n",
    "- Data Ingestion: Extract text from a PDF.\n",
    "- Chunking with Overlapping Context: Split text into overlapping chunks to preserve context.\n",
    "- Embedding Creation: Convert text chunks into numerical representations.\n",
    "- Context-Aware Retrieval: Retrieve relevant chunks along with their neighbors for better completeness.\n",
    "- Response Generation: Use a language model to generate responses based on retrieved context.\n",
    "- Evaluation: Assess the model's response accuracy."

      "Q: Where can I get first aid if hospitals are overwhelmed?\n",
      "AI: Okay, this is a really important question, especially in situations where hospitals are overwhelmed due to a disaster, pandemic, or other large-scale emergency.  Here's a breakdown of where you might be able to find first aid, prioritizing options based on severity of need and accessibility:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Assess the Severity of the Situation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Is it a true emergency (life-threatening)?**  If someone is unconscious, not breathing, has severe bleeding that can't be stopped, or is having a heart attack/stroke, **call emergency services (911 in the US, 112 in Europe, 000 in Australia, etc.) immediately.**  Even if hospitals are overwhelmed, they will triage and prioritize the most critical cases.  Follow their instructions.  Don't assume they won't respond.\n",
      "*   **Is it urgent but not immediately life-threatening?** (e.g., broken bone, deep cut, severe burn, allergic reaction).  These situations still require prompt medical attention, but you might have a little more time to explore options.\n",
      "*   **Is it a minor injury or illness?** (e.g., small cut, scrape, mild burn, headache, sprain).  These can often be managed at home with a well-stocked first-aid kit and some basic knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Potential First Aid Resources (in order of priority/likelihood):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Emergency Services (911 or your local equivalent):**  As mentioned above, always call for life-threatening emergencies.  Even if response times are delayed, they can provide guidance over the phone.  Be prepared to answer their questions clearly and concisely.\n",
      "*   **Urgent Care Centers (if available and not overwhelmed):**  Urgent care centers are a good option for injuries or illnesses that need prompt attention but are not life-threatening.  *Call ahead* to check their hours, availability, and whether they are accepting new patients.  Be aware that they may also be experiencing high patient volumes.\n",
      "*   **Designated Emergency Shelters/Disaster Relief Centers:**  In a large-scale disaster, local authorities (Red Cross, FEMA, etc.) often set up emergency shelters or relief centers. These locations often have medical personnel and basic first-aid supplies.  Check local news, radio, or official government websites for information on shelter locations.\n",
      "*   **Community Centers/Schools/Churches:**  In some emergencies, these locations may be used as temporary first-aid stations or gathering points for people needing assistance.  Again, check local news and official channels for information.\n",
      "*   **Neighbors/Community Members with Medical Training:**  In a crisis, people with medical backgrounds (doctors, nurses, EMTs, paramedics, even those with advanced first-aid training) may volunteer to help in their communities.  Reach out to your neighbors or community groups to see if anyone has medical skills and is willing to assist.  Be respectful of their time and expertise.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Primary Options:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Home Oxygen Concentrators:** This is the most common and convenient solution.  A home oxygen concentrator plugs into a standard electrical outlet and extracts oxygen from the air.  It doesn't require refilling tanks.  If you are prescribed oxygen, your doctor will likely prescribe a home concentrator.  This eliminates the need for frequent refills.\n",

      "*   **Oxygen Suppliers/Medical Equipment Companies:**  The company that provides your oxygen equipment is the most reliable source for refills.  They will have the proper equipment, trained staff, and safety protocols in place.  They may offer:\n",
      "    *   **Tank Exchange:** You bring in your empty tank and exchange it for a full one.\n",
      "    *   **Refilling Services:**  They refill your existing tank.\n",
      "    *   **Delivery:**  They deliver full tanks to your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hospitals and Clinics:**  Hospitals and clinics often have oxygen refilling capabilities, especially if they have respiratory therapy departments.  However, they are primarily focused on patient care, so refilling for non-patients might be limited or require special arrangements.  Call ahead to inquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations and Safety:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Prescription Required:**  In most places, you'll need a prescription from a doctor to obtain medical oxygen.  This is because oxygen is considered a medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Safety First:**  Oxygen is highly flammable.  Never attempt to refill an oxygen tank yourself unless you are specifically trained and have the proper equipment.  Improper handling can lead to explosions and serious injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Storage:**  Store oxygen tanks in a well-ventilated area, away from heat sources, open flames, and flammable materials.  Secure the tanks to prevent them from falling over.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel:**  If you plan to travel, contact your oxygen supplier well in advance.  They can help you arrange for oxygen refills at your destination or provide portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) that are FAA-approved for air travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs):**  POCs are battery-powered devices that extract oxygen from the air, similar to home concentrators.  They are much smaller and lighter than oxygen tanks, making them ideal for travel and active lifestyles.  The batteries can be recharged using a standard electrical outlet or a car adapter.  This is often the best solution for people who need oxygen on the go.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Find Local Suppliers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Online Search:** Use search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.  Search for \"oxygen suppliers near me,\" \"medical equipment companies near me,\" or \"oxygen tank refills [your city/state].\"\n",
      "*   **Your Doctor:**  Your doctor or respiratory therapist can provide you with a list of local oxygen suppliers.\n",
      "*   **Insurance Company:**  Your health insurance company may have a preferred network of oxygen suppliers.\n",
      "*   **Yellow Pages/Online Directories:**  Check online directories for medical equipment and supply companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Before You Go:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Call Ahead:**  Always call the supplier before visiting to confirm their hours, services, and any requirements (e.g., prescription, insurance information).\n",
      "*   **Tank Inspection:**  Have your oxygen tank inspected regularly by a qualified technician to ensure it is in good working condition.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Assess the Severity of the Situation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Is it a true emergency (life-threatening)?**  If someone is unconscious, not breathing, has severe bleeding that can't be stopped, or is having a heart attack/stroke, **call emergency services (911 in the US, 112 in Europe, 000 in Australia, etc.) immediately.**  Even if hospitals are overwhelmed, they will triage and prioritize the most critical cases.  Follow their instructions.  Don't assume they won't respond.\n",
      "*   **Is it urgent but not immediately life-threatening?** (e.g., broken bone, deep cut, severe burn, allergic reaction).  These situations still require prompt medical attention, but you might have a little more time to explore options.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Emergency Services (911 or your local equivalent):**  As mentioned above, always call for life-threatening emergencies.  Even if response times are delayed, they can provide guidance over the phone.  Be prepared to answer their questions clearly and concisely.\n",
      "*   **Urgent Care Centers (if available and not overwhelmed):**  Urgent care centers are a good option for injuries or illnesses that need prompt attention but are not life-threatening.  *Call ahead* to check their hours, availability, and whether they are accepting new patients.  Be aware that they may also be experiencing high patient volumes.\n",
      "*   **Designated Emergency Shelters/Disaster Relief Centers:**  In a large-scale disaster, local authorities (Red Cross, FEMA, etc.) often set up emergency shelters or relief centers. These locations often have medical personnel and basic first-aid supplies.  Check local news, radio, or official government websites for information on shelter locations.\n",
      "*   **Community Centers/Schools/Churches:**  In some emergencies, these locations may be used as temporary first-aid stations or gathering points for people needing assistance.  Again, check local news and official channels for information.\n",

      "*   **Travel:**  If you plan to travel, contact your oxygen supplier well in advance.  They can help you arrange for oxygen refills at your destination or provide portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) that are FAA-approved for air travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs):**  POCs are battery-powered devices that extract oxygen from the air, similar to home concentrators.  They are much smaller and lighter than oxygen tanks, making them ideal for travel and active lifestyles.  The batteries can be recharged using a standard electrical outlet or a car adapter.  This is often the best solution for people who need oxygen on the go.\n",

      "**How to Find Local Suppliers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Online Search:** Use search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.  Search for \"oxygen suppliers near me,\" \"medical equipment companies near me,\" or \"oxygen tank refills [your city/state].\"\n",
      "*   **Your Doctor:**  Your doctor or respiratory therapist can provide you with a list of local oxygen suppliers.\n",
      "*   **Insurance Company:**  Your health insurance company may have a preferred network of oxygen suppliers.\n",
      "*   **Yellow Pages/Online Directories:**  Check online directories for medical equipment and supply companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Before You Go:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Call Ahead:**  Always call the supplier before visiting to confirm their hours, services, and any requirements (e.g., prescription, insurance information).\n",
      "*   **Tank Inspection:**  Have your oxygen tank inspected regularly by a qualified technician to ensure it is in good working condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the best and safest way to recharge oxygen tanks is through a reputable oxygen supplier or medical equipment company.  Consider a home oxygen concentrator or a portable oxygen concentrator for greater convenience and independence.**\n",
